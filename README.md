# DeepSegment-Models
Pre-trained weights for DeepSegment (https://github.com/bedapudi6788/deepsegment)

# A major update is on the way for DeepSegment. Will be released by Jul 31, 2019.

This update will include the following:

1. tf serving images and clients from multiple languages (python, golang, nodejs to start with)
2. Very improved english model. (Based on millions of sentences from various sources, instead of the very limited Tatoeba data.)
3. Support for lot of languages. (English, French, German, Hindi, Telugu to start with)

This repository is being archived for now. (The pre-trained weights will be hosted on my personal server from now on).
